 WAIVER OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT 

Food preparation carries with it inherent risks that include but are not limited to health hazards resulting from improper transport, handling and storage. 
WAIVER: 
In consideration of being permitted to use the SPACE platform to obtain information relating to the availability of prepared foodstuffs, cooked, perishable or otherwise (the “ACTIVITIES”), I, for myself, my heirs, personal representatives or assigns, do hereby release, waive, discharge, and covenant not to sue SPACE, its officers, employees, and agents from liability from any and all claims including the negligence of SPACE, its officers, employees and agents, resulting in personal injury, accidents or illnesses (including death), and property loss arising from, but not limited to, participation in ACTIVITIES. 
ASSUMPTION OF RISKS 
Participation in ACTIVITIES carries with it certain inherent risks that cannot be eliminated regardless of the care taken to avoid injuries. The specific risks vary, but range from (1) Cooking Food Thoroughly; (2) Separating and not cross contaminating foods; (3) Chilling or refrigerating food appropriately; and (4) Cleaning foodstuffs, instruments and hands used in and for food preparation. 
INDEMNIFICATION AND HOLD HARMLESS 
I agree to INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS SPACE from any and all claims, actions, suits, procedures, costs, expenses, damages and liabilities, including attorney’s fees brought as a result of my involvement in ACTIVITIES, and to reimburse them for any such expenses incurred. 
SEVERABILITY 
The undersigned further expressly agrees that the foregoing Waiver and Assumption of Risk Agreement is intended to be as broad and inclusive as is permitted by the law of the State of California and that if any portion thereof is held invalid, it is agreed that the balance shall, notwithstanding, continue in full legal force and effect.
